    <p>The Government&rsquo;s  vision, set out most recently in 'Supporting Families in the Foundation Years', is that every child and  young person should have the opportunity to fulfill their potential. Sure Start  is at the forefront of transforming the way services are delivered for young  children and their families.</p>
    <p> The  aim of Sure Start Children&rsquo;s Centres is to improve outcomes for all children.  They are a vital part of the Government&rsquo;s ten-year childcare strategy to enable  all families with children to have access to an affordable, flexible,  high-quality childcare place for their child. The services offered by the Weybridge Children&rsquo;s  Centre include supporting families with finding childcare and early learning  settings for their children.</p>
    <p> Children&rsquo;s Centres bring together all the  different support agencies to offer a wide range of services to meet you and  your child&rsquo;s needs, all in one place.</p>
    <p> The Centres are somewhere your child can make friends and learn as they  play. You can get professional advice on health and family matters, learn about  training and job opportunities or just socialise with other people.</p>
    <p> There are just under 1800 0-5 year olds in the Weybridge children's centre reach area and we would urge all families to register with us so we can keep you informed with what is on offer.</p>

    <p>You will receive a warm welcome when you visit us at the  centre.
Since the summer of 2010 you can pop in for information and  advice between the hours of 9am and 4pm. This is your centre and we  welcome&nbsp;your ideas to include in our activities. </p>
    <p>Along with our office, the centre plays host to a main room for groups, a clinic room and as a special treat the 'Snoezelen' room. This room has been designed with 0-5 year olds with additional needs in mind, but  we welcome all parents and carers to ring up and book a slot to experience the instant relaxation and sense of calm from this room. All little ones love it!</p>

    <p>Our  Outreach Service is here to help with a variety of things; family life is not  always plain sailing and we are here to help when things are a little  challenging. We have helped families with getting back to work, finding the  right childcare, joining a language course, parenting strategies and so on. This support can be arranged during any of the sessions we provide but also through our parenting or play and art sessions but can also be given by seeing  you at home. </p>
    <p>It is always your choice how you would like us to support you.  Sarah and Daphne both carry out outreach work and you can refer yourself for  this service by contacting us, alternatively you can ask your Health Visitor to  refer you.</p>

    <p>Every term  we run a fabulous parenting programme called the &lsquo;Parenting Puzzle&rsquo; for  families who want to get more out of family life. The main principles of this  programme are empathy, appropriate expectations, positive discipline, self awareness and self esteem. The family support we offer is based on this programme  and it really makes a difference to the difficult job parenting can be.</p>
