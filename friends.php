	<p>The Weybridge Sure Start Children's Centre is an integral part of the local community. We pride ourselves in building positive relationships with the community and invite all families, service providers, local charities and organisations to link up with us.</p>
    <p>We want to develop a 'Friends of Weybridge CC' forum for parents to discuss the services and to feedback to the centre what would be most needed locally so that parents are supported with their child's school readiness, child and family health as well as parental aspirations. In particular local parents of 0-5 year  olds are invited to contact us with any ideas they may have to develop such a forum. Please call or text Daphne on 07824995202 or email your thoughts to centreleader@weybridgecc.org. Many thanks.</p>

	<p>We are  particularly keen for parents to be represented on the Advisory Board which  meets 3 times each year for 1.5 hours. Parents are welcome to volunteer during,  before and after sessions and to be part of the Parents' Forum &quot;Friends of  Weybridge Children's Centre&quot;. This may all sound very serious but the meetings  are informal and shape the centre's service so parental input is vital. If you  are interested in supporting the centre with any of these activities then  please contact Daphne for more information. Thank you!</p>
