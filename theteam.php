    <p>The Children's Centre team is dedicated to local families getting the best out of family life and youngsters enjoying the best start in life. We are able to do this because we are energetic and enthusiastic-with a wide range of training, qualifications and experience between us.</p>

    <p class="quote"><img src="images/beginquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" />It is my responsibility to ensure that the centre offers what the local families need. Before taking up this post I worked at Cleves school and I have lots of experience of working with children and families.<img src="images/endquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" /></p>
    <p>Daphne is a qualified counsellor, her professional  background is service orientated and she enjoys making sure the local families  are given top quality service at all times. In 2010 Daphne gained the post graduate National Professional Qualification of Integrated Centre Leadership</p>

    <p class="quote"><img src="images/beginquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" />I offer outreach and  family support in a way that best suits each individual family. I believe a  problem shared is a problem halved and can help in many ways. I was a childminder  and an office manager previously and am a mum myself. I also run lots of  activity groups which are explained on our activities page.<img src="images/endquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" /></p>
    <p>Sarah has a special  ability to empathise with families who find themselves in challenging  situations. Sarah is qualified in Childcare and Working with Families.</p>

    <p class="quote"><img src="images/beginquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" />I am here to advise families  and give information about health services, early years&rsquo; education, local  childcare services, training and employment opportunities and much more. I have  a background in preschool education and I particularly enjoy helping little and  big people move on in life.<img src="images/endquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" /></p>
    <p>Yvette has undertaken  extensive training over the years and is very well informed about national and  local services so that all people who contact the centre are helped  effectively.</p>

    <p class="quote"><img src="images/beginquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" />I perform a similar role to Yvette but also maintain our databases and run Play and Art and other groups at the end of the week. I have a varied background in business administration roles working for multinational companies over ten years and most recently ran my own local Domestic Cleaning Business for almost 8 years.  I have have 2 school age children of my own and have lived and worked in the area all my life.<img src="images/endquote.jpg" width="18" height="15" alt="&quot;" /></p>
    <p>Katie is the centre's 'eyes and ears' as she has a child in the 0-5 age range. If Katie flags up something that is important for families with young children we can be sure it is!</p>
